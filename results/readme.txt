Results directory
==================
There are 3 subdirectories:
- Cluster membership lists featuring positions, PMs parallaxes, Gaia phot. magnitudes, membership probabilties and source IDs of all members;
- Tables featuring mean astrometric values and probabilities (e.g. classification, HDBSCAN persistence, CST p-value);
- Visualisations produced via analysis. They include four panel plots (position, Parallax, PM and CMD), radial surface density profiles, PM dispersion fits, among others.
