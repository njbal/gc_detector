Scripts for cluster detection search algorithm
===============================================

Directory features python scripts and Jupyter notebooks

Order in which notebooks must be run:
1. implementation.ipynb -> basic search algorithm, classification, CST, generation of membership lists, and  visualisations
2. further_cluster_analysis.ipynb -> radial profile fits, distance derivation, proper motion dispersion, and accompanying visualisations

Directory also features data files consisting of known GCs (vb21-gc), OCs (hr24-oc) and dSphs (dr20-dsph). 
These files are used to crossmatch the clusters we detect with those reported in literature.
